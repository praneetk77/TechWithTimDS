For KNN,

in n-d space we have points corresponding to our training set
then, for any new prediction, we calculate its distance from all other points
then, we sort these distances and find the k-closest points
in these k points, we need to look for the majority in clusters, and that is the predicted group for this point

Points to remember :-
K must be odd
K must not be too high

Drawbacks :-
No point saving model, for every prediction, calculations are repeated
